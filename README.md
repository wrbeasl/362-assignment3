# 362-assignment3


I worked on this assignment with William Beasley and Sarah Strickland. My role in completing the assignment was the development and testing of the sorting and sending algorithms in static_mpi.c as well as the development of the workload.pbs script. William Beasley developed and tested the workload assignment algorithm in dynamic_mpi.c. Sarah Strickland developed the receiving algorithms in both static_mpi.c and dynamic_mpi.c. We used only course materials in our development. Including a few very useful whiteboards.
